            <img src="images/cat drawing.png" alt="cat" style="width:100%">
            <p>This a sketch of my cat millie but it turned out to look more like my cat Beep
               This is one of my fav sketches of an animal that ive done because its personal to me.

            <div class="numbertext">2 / 8</div>
            <img src="images/wallie.png" alt="Green Overlook" style="width:100%">
            <p>This is a sketch of a character I made called Wallie. 
                I was expertimenting with drawing bodies and legs and he 
                is the first character I made with a "body" </p>
            </div>
                    
            <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">3 / 8</div>
            <img src="images/PAUL.png" alt="Pink Beach" style="width:100%">
            <p>These were my first two characters that I sketched that had bodies. 
                I already had Paul as a character but he never had a body. I then created 
                Sage from scratch.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">4 / 8</div>
            <img src="images/shapes.png" alt="cat" style="width:100%">
            <p>This was the 2nd sketch in my sketch book and Its the ONLY sketch that I coloured
                and theres a reason why. I don't like the look of colour in my sketches, I think it
                made this sketch look "tacky or chunky" becuase I use a 0.05mm size pen on all my sketches 
                I think it hides that and replaced it with big colours.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">5 / 8</div>
            <img src="images/theo.png" alt="Pink Beach" style="width:100%">
            <p>This is a character that I saw on pintrest and I really liked
                the style. I liked the spiral eye becuase I always add small spirals to the 
                background of my sketches once im finished with sketching.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">6 / 8</div>
            <img src="images/bodies.png" alt="Pink Beach" style="width:100%">
            <p>This is another one of my tests at sketching bodies. I wanted to have a 
                range of different body types because that expands my drawing possibilities.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">7 / 8</div>
            <img src="images/bert.png" alt="Pink Beach" style="width:100%">
            <p>Bert is my first ever sketch ive done so he will always be one of the best
               I would change some of the things i've sketched, like his legs not looking so crazy but 
               I still really like how it came out.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="mySlides fade">
            <div class="numbertext">8 / 8</div>
            <img src="images/tony.png" alt="Pink Beach" style="width:100%">
            <p> This is the one and only BonyTony, I really like this character because 1. his face looks 
                amazing, 2. His body came out exactly the way I wanted and finally 3. His name describes him 
                perfectly and its also just a great name.</p>
